# Humanoid Robots Seminar


This seminar lecture consists of reading academic papers and making inferences about studies in the humanoid robots area


## Content

Relevant documents can be found in reports and presentations in detail


### Motivation

-In real-world, the robot needs to be more sensitive to respond to the environment
-The robot centaur-like wheeled-legged CENTAURO should travel safely 

-Procedure: Terrain segmentation and roughness estimations modifications by end-to-end deep convolutional neural networks

-Test: Dataset modification with terrain images and roughness values

-the model applications on the Robot; 
-balancing configuration for safe traveling
-leg configuration for path planning
