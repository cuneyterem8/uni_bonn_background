    "GANs are Neural Networks that take random variables as input and generate outputs. A discriminator is going to predict if this output belongs to a target distribution or not (distribution of the training set). Once the network is trained, you can generate a variety of outputs just by sampling the initial random input and forwarding through the generator.\n",
