# Neural Networks


Most of the exercises include heavily theoretical math and some practical coding


## Content

Multi-layer perceptron, radial-basis function nets, Hopfield nets, self organizing maps (Kohonen), adaptive resonance theory, learning vector quantization, recurrent networks, back-propagation of error, reinforcement learning, Q-learning, support vector machines, pulse processing neural networks. Exemplary applications of neural nets: function approximation, prediction, quality control, image processing, speech processing, action planning, control of technical processes and robots. Implementation of neural networks in hardware and software: tools, simulators, analog and digital neural hardware
