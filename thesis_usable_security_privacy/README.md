# Usable Security and Privacy Thesis: Improving Letâ€™s Hash: Development of a website helping developers with security-related programming tasks


This thesis is based on the improvement of the existing LetsHashSalt website for developers to increase password security awareness while implementing code for six different programming languages with source code, reports, and presentations


## Content

Relevant implementations are partial due to avoid non-allowed code content, the documents can be found in reports and presentations in detail, full video of website can be seen in video file.


### Motivation

Password security has always been a significant issue for software developers and users. At first glance, it may seem that software developers care a lot about security. However, many studies have shown that software developers should be at least as careful as users due to a lack of security concerns. For this reason, different infrastructures have been developed to support software developers in many fields. One example is the LetsHashSalt website, a platform that allows software developers to write more secure password authentication. 

The primary purpose of this thesis is to expand the features of the LetsHashSalt website, make it appealing to more programmers, and help them to write secure password authentication codes in different languages.

That is why we added new programming languages to the website, such as Javascript, PHP, Golang, C# languages, and libraries like Pbkdf2 and Regex. In addition, we asked five professional software developers who are experts in their fields to test the security of the code blocks.

Finally, we made it a more comprehensive, secure password authentication website that many software developers can use
