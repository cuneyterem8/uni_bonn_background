1) Theoritical task is inside of DLVR_Assignment_1_vf.pdf

2) Programming task can be seen as test_1.html or test_1.ipynb, KNNClassifier.py and Dataset.py
Part a and b are mostly done but c is not done. 
To run the code, you need 'load_mnist.py' and 't10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz', 't10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz', 
'train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz', 'train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz' folders.
