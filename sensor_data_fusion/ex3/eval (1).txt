Total points sheet 1: 7.5 / 10

Programming Part [4/4]
    (1) implementation of kalman filter {2/2}

    (2) reasonable comparison and visualization {2/2} technically correct, but should be applied to simulated measurements, eventhough its not stated explicitly
        
Theoretical Part [3.5/6]
    (1) Retrodiction step { 1/1}

    (2) why can't retrodiction improve the current estimate? { 1/1}

    (3) need and effects product formula { 0.5/1} please argue with dependency/ undependency of x

    (4) product formula 
        - first proof {1 /1} matrix notation more suitable
        - second proof, induction { 0/1.5}
        - comment on proportionality { 0/0.5}
