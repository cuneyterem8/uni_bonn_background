Total points sheet 1: 7 / 10

Programming Part [2/3]
    (1) plot trajectory (2/3)
        - correct calculation of measured data {2/2}
        - reasonable presentation of data {0/1} 
        
Theoretical Part [5/7]
    (1) Kalman filter (3/3)
        - individual steps (0.5 each) {2/2}
        - coherent explaination {1/1}

    (2) combination of measurements from different sensors (1/2)
        - how can measurements be combined {0/1} exact procedure still unclear
        - comment on accuracy {1/1}

    (3) application of (2) (1/2)
        - calculation of combined measurement {0/1} no combination taking place
        - coordinate conversion {1/1}
