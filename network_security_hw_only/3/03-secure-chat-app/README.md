# Secure Chat App (6 points)
In this task you are going to implement a chat application which allows two
users to send messages to each other. The application itself can be really
simple and doesn't have to be anything fancy.

# Part 1
Implement the chat app and make sure that the confidentiality of the
messages sent is ensured.

# Part 2
Extend the application from part 1, so that not only the confidentiality but
also the integrity of the messages is ensured.

# Part 3
Extend the application so that the origin of the messages can be proved.

To solve this task, submit the source code of your application and a brief
description of how you ensured the three properties defined in parts 1 to 3.
