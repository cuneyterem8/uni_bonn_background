# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange MITM (2 points)
There are two hosts in the SecLab which are using the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange to generate a shared secret. Unfortunately, the hosts can't
communicate directly with each other, so they need someone to forward
they messages. This is your task!

Connect to port `1976` on host `alvinne.netsec.seclab-bonn.de` and to port
`1969` on host `founders.netsec.seclab-bonn.de` and figure out what the hosts
are sending. Forward the messages and make the hosts send the secret of your
group.

To solve this task, submit your secret, all code and data you used, and a brief
description of how you obtained the secret.
