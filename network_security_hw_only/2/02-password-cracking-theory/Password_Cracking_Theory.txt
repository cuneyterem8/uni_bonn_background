Dictionary Attacks
	What do we learn about how most users picked their passwords?

		Most users choose passwords that are easy to remember and easy or fast to type in.

	Is your favorite password in the list (optional)?

		...

Brute-Force Attacks

	To solve this task, provide the function you used to compute the size of the search space,
	the number of passwords that your computer is able to crack,
	and some example computation for password hashing algorithms of your choice.

		A - Number of characters
		n - Length of password

		Size of search space:
			A^n

		Input:"test123"
		SHA-256: 		ecd71870d1963316a97e3ac3408c9835ad8cf0f3c1bc703527c30265534f75ae
		SHA-512: 		daef4953b9783365cad6615223720506cc46c5167cd16ab500fa597aa08ff964eb24fb19687f34d7665f778fcb6c5358fc0a5b81e1662cf90f73a2671c53f991

Secure Passwords

	What is more efficient to increase the size of the password search space:
	increasing the password length of increasing the size of the alphabet?

		The number of possible passwords is bigger when the character set is increased:

		(N+1)^n > N^(n+1)

		However the number of possible passwords does not equal it's ability to get cracked.

		"Mathematically, the LENGTH of the password is exponentially more important than the complexity of the character-set used."

	How would you define "weak" and "strong" passwords in general? Why?

		Strong passwords minimize the risk to get cracked by maximizing the search space,i.e.
		 -making use of all different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special signs),
		 -making use of the maximum allowed password length,
		 -avoiding words or phrases in general, or at least those that can be found in dictionaries.
		Weak passwords do not match those categories

		The terms weak and strong are context sensitive,
		online banking demands for a very strong password while a weaker password might still be strong enough for your tumblr.

		In the best case, a strong password is generated by a good random password generator.

Storing Passwords

	Why is a hash function used and not some kind of encryption to store passwords securely?

		Encrypting a password would demand for storing another password.
		At some point a non-encrypted password would need to be stored,
		wich then could be used to decrypt all added layers of encryption.
		Storing a hash makes it "impossible" for an attacker to get hold of the actual password,
		while still allowing the server to do password verification.

	Find examples of hash functions which are recommended to store passwords nowadays.

		SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD, WHIRLPOOL, ...
