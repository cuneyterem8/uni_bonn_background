ECB: Decryption is done by setting $p_i = D_k(c_i)$. Hence given $c_1|c_2|c_4|...|c_8, it is possible to get every $p_i$ except $p_3$, i.e. we do not get the actual message $m = p_1 |...| p_8$ but a significant part of it, $m' = p_1|p_2|p_4|...|p_8$. 
That we can derive $m'$ should be trivial. We are absolutely not able to derive $p_3$ as for $c$ chosen uniformly at random in the ciphertext space, $c = E_k(p)$ for some uniformly chosen p in the plaintext space, hence D_k(c)=p uniformly at random in the plaintext space, i.e. if we do not know anything about $c_3$ (this is the case) we cannot know anything about $p_3$.

CBC: Decryption is done by setting $p_i = D_k(c_i) \oplus c_{i-1}$, where $c_0 = IV$ the inialisation vector chosen uniformly at random (at most). Having not $c_3$ we get only three quarters of the message $m = p_1|...|p_8$, namely $m'=p_1|p_2|p_5|...|p_8$. That we can derive $m'$ is clear; that we cannot derive $p_3|p_4$ can be argued as follows:
We cannot derive $p_4$ as $c_3$ is missing, hence the best we can do is guess $c_3$ and work with the guess. But the binary sum of two values, one of them chosen at random, is again random, so $p_4$ could be everything depending on randomness of $c_3$.
We cannot derive $p_3$ using similiar arguments as in the ECB case: best we can do is guess $c_3$ randomly, then $D_k(c_3)$ is random and as the binary sum of two values, provided at least one of them is random, is random, $p_3$ again could be everything depending on randomness of $c_3$.

CTR: Decryption is done by setting $p_i = c_i \oplus E_k(ctr_i)$. This one is a bit tricky as we have to distinguish two cases:
1.) The receiver knows that $c_3$ is missing and uses the counter from 0 to 7
2.) He does not know and therefore uses the counter from 0 to 6
Lets start with 1.): Here, it is trivial that $m' = p_1|p_2|p_4|...|p_8$ can be derived. $p_3$ cannot be derived by the same reasons as in the CBC case: As $c_3$ can only be guessed randomly, and as the binary sum of the values, one of them chosen at random, is random again, $p_3$ does depend on randomness of $c_3$, i.e. can be everything.
Now, lets do the trickier case 2.): Here, the receiver thinks of $c_i$ as $c_{i-1}$ for $4 \leq i \leq 8$, hence he will use the right counter for deriving $p_1$ and $p_2$ and therefore get these values. He will not get $p_3$ as he does not try to, but will try to derive $p_i$ for $4 \leq i \leq 8$ by the following formula $p'_i = c_i \oplus E_k(ctr_{i-1}) (= p_i \oplus E_k(ctr_{i}) \oplus E_k(ctr_{i-1}))$, i.e. by using the wrong counter value. But this would only work iff $E_k(ctr_{i}) = E_k(ctr_{i-1})$, which yields a contradiction using $D_k(-)$ on both sides. Hence he derives wrong $p_4|...|p_8$ and in the end he only has $m'=p_1|p_2$
