# Quantum Insert (3 points)
Find out what the "Quantum Insert" attack is. Implement the attack to intercept and replace the PuTTY download hosted in the SecLab at `http://cantillon.netsec.seclab-bonn.de/` (this site is available from within the SecLab only). Make sure that a possible user of the download service will not be able to detect your replacement.

To check whether your attack is successful, run the `download-putty` tool. It will simulate a user visiting our download page. Note that the command takes some time (about 10 seconds), since we slowed down the server for you.

Moreover, answer the following questions in a short and concise way.

#### How can the user check whether the downloaded file is legitimate and untampered with?

#### Is the information provided on the web page sufficient for the user to decide whether the download was untampered with? Why or why not?

#### If the information is not sufficient, how would you make sure that your users can verify their downloads?

#### How can a Quantum Insert attack be detected?


To solve this task, submit
 - your tool implementing the Quantum Insert attack
 - the output of `download-putty`
 - the answers to the questions stated above
